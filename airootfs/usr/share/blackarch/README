[ NETWORK ]

  - Network is not configured by default because of security reasons. To enable
    it run: systemctl start NetworkManager.
    Attention: if NetworkManager applet doesn't prompt for password, logout and
    login again. This is because when we start NetworkManager the keyring wasn't
    unlocked.

[ INSTALL ]

  - BlackArch is Arch Linux, so installation is manual. This give you total
    control of what is being installed and make sure this system is right for
    you.
  - Although we highly recommend using the offline installation process. Check:
